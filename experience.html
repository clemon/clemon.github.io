          <h2>Microsoft - Software Development Engineer Intern</h2>
          <strong>June 2014 - September 2014</strong>

          <p>
              I spent the summer working as a developer on the OneDrive team. I spent the
              summer working to ship a new feature, which forced me to act as a full-stack web
              developer, creating an API in the back-end code base and UI in the front-end.
              That's about as specific as I can get before my feature is live due to my NDA.

          <h2>Antengo - Mobile Development Intern</h2>
          <strong>September 2013 - April 2014</strong>

          <p>
              Worked on a cross-platform mobile application for real-time classifieds. For the
              Windows Phone client, I was in a development role, where the goal was to make
              the app release-ready. For the Android app, I served more of a quality assurance
              role, finding and fixing bugs.

          <h2>ThoughtSTEM - Mentor and Summer Camp Leader</h2>
          <strong>June 2013 - September 2013</strong>

          <p>
              At ThoughtSTEM, I spent the summer teaching a wide variety of kids from ages
              eight to eighteen the basics of programming. It was my responsibility to create
              the curriculum and lead classes on Alice, Arduino, Processing, Robotics,
              Unity3D, and Android.
